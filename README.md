# HW04
Due Monday July 27th

### Option 1
Explore a dataset. That's right, like last week find some data online or use your own data and manipulate it and explore it to create some data summaries.  You can look at that homework for a list of datasets. Make use of the major dplyr functions select(), mutate(), arrange(), group_by(), summarize(), count() or baseR equivalents (there isn't a good baseR equivalent for many of these functions though). If you are using a Rmd, think about making your table summaries and printing them nicely with knitr::kable() and still think about plotting some data.  

### Option 2
I'm also providing a more traditional HW assignment, similar to HW02 this week if you are just wanting to have a more traditional assignment. It uses data from FiveThirtyEight to explore gun deaths from 2012-2014. [See the HW04.Rmd file for details.](HW04.Rmd)


I selected Option 2. [See the HW04.Rmd file for the assignment.](HW04.Rmd) I didn't manage to complete all of the tasks.
