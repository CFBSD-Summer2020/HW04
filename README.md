# HW04
Lucas Dyer
Due Monday July 27th

### Hello,  I went with the second option, which can be found [here](HW04.md). I wasn unable to fully complete it, as I got hung up in several spots. After doing some googling and skimming the other submissions, I made a bit of progress, but obviously there was quite a bit to go. I welcome any notes and would love suggestions on how to properly finish the assignment.
