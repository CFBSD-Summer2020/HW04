# HW04
Due Monday July 27th

### I chose to do the Option 1 assignment, for which the instructions were:
<blockquote>Explore a dataset. That's right, like last week find some data online or use your own data and manipulate it and explore it to create some data summaries.  You can look at that homework for a list of datasets. Make use of the major dplyr functions select(), mutate(), arrange(), group_by(), summarize(), count() or baseR equivalents (there isn't a good baseR equivalent for many of these functions though). If you are using a Rmd, think about making your table summaries and printing them nicely with knitr::kable() and still think about plotting some data.</blockquote>

The code for this assignment is called R_script_HW04.R and is available [here.](R_script_HW04.R)
The dataset is called Conv_data_for_HW04.xlsx and is available [here.](Conv_data_for_HW04.xlsx)
