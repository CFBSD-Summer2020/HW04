## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
##HW option 1: Explore a dataset. That's right, like last week find some data online or use your own data and manipulate it and explore it to create some data summaries. You can look at that homework for a list of datasets. Make use of the major dplyr functions select(), mutate(), arrange(), group_by(), summarize(), count() or baseR equivalents (there isn't a good baseR equivalent for many of these functions though). If you are using a Rmd, think about making your table summaries and printing them nicely with knitr::kable() and still think about plotting some data.

```{r}

#Loading in the dataset 

RNASeqEMT <- read_excel("~/Documents/RNA seq analysis/Diff Exp Genes accumulated data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "R data")


#I want to make a plot showing only genes that are significantly upregulated by both ATP and TGF-Beta at either 2 or 6 hours. 

#Finding genes upregulated by either ATP or TGFB at 2 hours or 6 hours and selecting this data from original dataset:

ATPsigRNASeqEMT <- RNASeqEMT %>%
  filter(Treatment_type == "ATP", Significant == "Yes") %>%
 distinct(Gene_name)
  
TGFBsigRNASeqEMT <- RNASeqEMT %>%
  filter(Treatment_type == "TGFB", Significant == "Yes") %>%
  distinct(Gene_name)

ATPandTGFB <- rbind(ATPsigRNASeqEMT, TGFBsigRNASeqEMT)
  
ATPandTGFBduplicates <-duplicated(ATPandTGFB$Gene_name)

print(ATPandTGFBduplicates) 

Commongenes <- ATPandTGFB %>%
  slice(10, 11, 25, 30, 31, 32, 37) 

MMP10 <- RNASeqEMT %>%
  filter(Gene_name == "MMP10")

BMP2 <- RNASeqEMT %>%
  filter(Gene_name == "BMP2")

NFKB1 <- RNASeqEMT %>%

HGF <- RNASeqEMT %>%

Final_data <- rbind(MMP10, BMP2, NFKB1, MMP1, MMP3, IL6, HGF)


#Now, Plot the data:
