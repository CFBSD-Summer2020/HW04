Exploring Gun Deaths in America (2012 - 2014)
================

## 1\. Load the packages and read in the gun deaths data

``` r
# Load the packages

library(tidyverse) 
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Read in the data - fread() requires loading data.table package

gun_deaths <- fread("gun_deaths.csv")
```

## 2\. Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month in years 2012-2014 and print with kable()

``` r
# Sort the data by month

arranged_by_month <- gun_deaths %>%
    arrange(month)

# Change the numbers of the months to the abbreviations of months' names

arranged_by_month$month <- factor(arranged_by_month$month, c(1:12), labels = month.abb)

# Generate a table summarizing numbers of deaths in each month of the year

deaths_per_month <- table(arranged_by_month$month)

# Convert the table to a data frame

deaths_per_month_df <- data.frame(deaths_per_month)

# Print the table with modified column names; align the values in the columns

kable(deaths_per_month_df, col.names = c("Month", "Number of deaths"), align = "lc", format = "markdown")
```

| Month | Number of deaths |
| :---- | :--------------: |
| Jan   |       8273       |
| Feb   |       7093       |
| Mar   |       8289       |
| Apr   |       8455       |
| May   |       8669       |
| Jun   |       8677       |
| Jul   |       8989       |
| Aug   |       8783       |
| Sep   |       8508       |
| Oct   |       8406       |
| Nov   |       8243       |
| Dec   |       8413       |

## 3\. Generate a bar chart showing the total number of gun deaths per month in years 2012-2014

``` r
# Change the column names in the data frame

colnames(deaths_per_month_df) <- c("Month", "Number")

# Create a bar plot

bar_plot <- ggplot(data = deaths_per_month_df, aes(x = Month, y = Number, width = 0.75)) +
  
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", fill = brewer.pal(length(unique(deaths_per_month_df$Month)), "Set3")) +
    
    labs(title = "Number of gun deaths in US by month (total for years 2012-14)", x = "Month", y = "Number of deaths") +

    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, family = "Tahoma", face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.x = element_text(colour="black", size = 12, face = "bold"),
          axis.title.y = element_text(colour="black", size = 12, face = "bold"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size = 10),
          axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size = 10),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
    
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000), limits = c(0, 10000)) 

bar_plot
```

## 4\. Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intent cause of death

``` r
# Sort the data by intent

arranged_by_intent <- gun_deaths %>%
    arrange(intent)

# Generate a table summarizing deaths by intent

deaths_by_intent <- table(arranged_by_intent$intent)

# Convert the table to a data frame

deaths_by_intent_df <- data.frame(deaths_by_intent)

# Print the table with modified column names; align the values in the columns

kable(deaths_by_intent_df, col.names = c("Intent", "Number of gun deaths"), align = "lc", format = "markdown")
```

| Intent        | Number of gun deaths |
| :------------ | :------------------: |
| Accidental    |         1639         |
| Homicide      |        35176         |
| Not Available |          1           |
| Suicide       |        63175         |
| Undetermined  |         807          |

``` r
# Change the column names in the data frame

colnames(deaths_by_intent_df) <- c("Intent", "Number")

# Create a bar plot (specify the order of bars - from highest to lowest number of deaths)

bar_plot_intent <- ggplot(data = deaths_by_intent_df, aes(x = reorder(Intent, -Number), y = Number, width = 0.75, fill = Intent)) +
    
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", fill = brewer.pal(length(unique(deaths_by_intent_df$Intent)), "Set3")) +
    
    labs(title = "Number of gun deaths in US by intent (total for years 2012-14)", x = "Intent", y = "Number of deaths") +

    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, family = "Tahoma", face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
          legend.position = "none", 
          axis.title.x = element_text(colour="black", size = 12, face = "bold"),
          axis.title.y = element_text(colour="black", size = 12, face = "bold"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size = 10),
          axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size = 10),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
    
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000), limits = c(0, 70000))

## 5\. Generate a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims by sex

``` r
# Generate a data frame with data about sex and age of victims; does not include the rows where the age is not available

by_sex_age <- gun_deaths %>%
    select(sex,age) %>%
    arrange(age) %>%

# Change age variable from factor to double

by_sex_age$age <- as.numeric(as.character(by_sex_age$age))

# Change the values in the sex column to include full words Female and Male

by_sex_age$sex <- factor(by_sex_age$sex, c("F", "M"), c("Female", "Male"))

# Generate a boxplot

ggplot(by_sex_age, aes(x = sex, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
    
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) +
  
    labs(title = "Age of gun death victims by sex (for years 2012-14)", x = "Sex", y = "Age") +

    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, family = "Tahoma", face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),

          axis.title.y = element_text(colour="black", size = 12, face = "bold"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", size = 11, face = "bold"),
          axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black", size = 10),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
    
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100), limits = c(0, 100)) +

    annotate("text", x = 0.55, y = 43.7, label = "43.7", fontface = 2)

    ## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).

```

| Average age of female victims |

## 6\. Determine the number of white males with at least a high school education who were killed by guns in 2012

``` r

### *Police was involved in less than 1.5% of total cases of death by guns. The absolute number of cases was the highest for people of age 21 to 30 independently from police involvement. Among the cases, in which police was involved, the highest percentage of victims were people of age 21 to 30. The second highest fraction were people of ages 31-40. Among the deaths, in which police was involved, the victims older than 60 comprised around than 5%, whereas among the cases, in which police was not involved, they comprised around 20%. Police was generally more involved in the cases of gun deaths among younger part of the population.*

\#\#\# White people comprise the highest percentage of cases, in which
police was and was not involved (which is expected due to their higher
representation in the general population). The percentage of cases
involving Black and Hispanic people, in which police was involved, was
higher than in cases where police was not involved, with the difference
being particularly bigger for Hispanics.

### *Percentage of cases involving Black people, in which police was involved, was decreasing with the age of victims. Similar trend was observed for the cases involving Hispanics (with the exception of cases involving victims above the age of 60). Conversely, the percentage of cases involving White people generally increased with age.*

### *Among the cases, in which police was not involved, the trends are similar, with one of the exceptions being the percentage of White victims decreasing with age between the first and second decade of life.*
