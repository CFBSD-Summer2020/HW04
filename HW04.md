Exploring Gun Deaths in America
================

## Objectives

  - To explore gun death data curated by FiveThirtyEight [original data
    available here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) by
      - Month
      - Intent
      - Age and sex
      - Education
      - Season
      - Intent by race
      - Police-relatedness

## Read in the data

The gun\_deaths.csv is provided in the repository.

``` r
library(tidyverse)    # load tidyverse packages, including ggplot2
library(magrittr)    # For pipe sign
library(knitr)    # To pretty print tables
library(ggpubr)    # For p-value bars

# read in the data
gun_deaths = read.csv("gun_deaths.csv")
```

## Generating a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month and printing using `kable()`.

Knitr is part of the knitr package. Allows you to change column names
and add captions and make pretty tables in your knitted document. Hint:
set the argument format = “markdown”

``` r
deaths_per_month = gun_deaths %>%
    count(month)
kable(deaths_per_month, format = "markdown")
```

| month |    n |
| ----: | ---: |
|     1 | 8273 |
|     2 | 7093 |
|     3 | 8289 |
|     4 | 8455 |
|     5 | 8669 |
|     6 | 8677 |
|     7 | 8989 |
|     8 | 8783 |
|     9 | 8508 |
|    10 | 8406 |
|    11 | 8243 |
|    12 | 8413 |

### Generating a bar chart with human-readable labels on the x-axis. That is, each month should be labeled “Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar” (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

``` r
month_labels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
               "Jul", "Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
deaths_per_month %>%
    mutate(month_lab = month_labels[month]) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(month_lab, month), y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")    # 'identity' means you've already done the summarization
```

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/month_chart-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
    #scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month_labels)

# The easier way do to exactly the same thing:
# Set 'month' as x aesthetics, and add the last commented line
# However, it is fun to achieve this by mutating the original tibble
```

## Generating a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intent cause of death. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest values.

``` r
deaths_by_intent = gun_deaths %>%
    count(intent)
deaths_by_intent %>%    # Not sure why cannot pipe here
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(intent, -n), y = n)) +    # -n means descending sort by n
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/intent-1.png)<!-- -->

## Generating a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims, by sex. Print the average age of female gun death victims.

``` r
gun_deaths_num_age = gun_deaths %>%
    # avoid unexpected behavoir when directly converting factors to numerics
    mutate(num_age = as.numeric(as.character(age))) %>%
    # also rm NA
    filter(is.na(num_age) == FALSE)
gun_deaths_num_age %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = num_age)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/age_&_sex-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
gun_deaths_num_age %>%
    filter(sex == "F") %>%
    summarize(ave_age = mean(num_age)) %>%
    print()
```

    ##    ave_age
    ## 1 43.69507

Above is the average age of female gun death victims

## How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?

``` r
gun_deaths %>%
    filter(race == "White", sex == "M",
           education %in% c("BA+", "HS/GED", "Some college"),
           year == 2012) %>%
    count() %>%
    print()
```

    ##       n
    ## 1 15199

Above is the number of white… in 2012 got killed

## Which season of the year has the most gun deaths?

Assume that:

  - Winter = January-March
  - Spring = April-June
  - Summer = July-September
  - Fall = October-December

<!-- end list -->

``` r
season_labs = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall")
gun_deaths %>%
    mutate(season = season_labs[as.integer((month - 1) / 3) + 1]) %>%
    count(season) %>%
    arrange(desc(season)) %>%
    top_n(1, season) %>%
    print()
```

    ##   season     n
    ## 1 Winter 23655

Above is the season with the most gun deaths.

# These are more open ended questions from here on out, you could look at making multiple summaries or types of plots.

### Are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does this compare to blacks and hispanics?

``` r
intent_count = gun_deaths %>%
    filter(intent == "Homicide" | intent == "Suicide",
           # In C/C++, one may want to use || and && for logic OR and AND.
           # However in R, | is different from ||, that | can return a vector of Booleans. | is usually preferrred
           race %in% c("White", "Hispanic", "Black")) %>%
    group_by(race) %>%
    count(intent) 
intent_count %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = race, y = n, fill = intent)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")
```

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/race-1.png)<!-- -->

(hint maybe looking at percentages would be good)

``` r
# Actually, I think the bar plot above is quite abvious
intent_count %>%
    # Notice it is still grouped by race
    transmute(race, intent, intent_percent = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
    kable(format = "markdown")
```

| race     | intent   | intent\_percent |
| :------- | :------- | --------------: |
| Black    | Homicide |        85.41284 |
| Black    | Suicide  |        14.58716 |
| Hispanic | Homicide |        63.98637 |
| Hispanic | Suicide  |        36.01363 |
| White    | Homicide |        14.17722 |
| White    | Suicide  |        85.82278 |

Above shows the percent of homi- / sui- cide among different race
groups.

### Are police-involved gun deaths significantly different from other gun deaths? Assess the relationship between police involvement and age, police involvement and race, and the intersection of all three variables.

``` r
# Age in involved/not involved groups
gun_deaths_num_age %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(police), y = num_age)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("not involved", "involved"), breaks = c(0, 1)) +
    labs(title = "Age in police involved/not involved groups")
```

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/police%20vs%20age-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Num of deaths in involved/not involved groups of different races
gun_deaths_modified = gun_deaths_num_age %>%
    mutate(police_lab = c("not involved", "involved")[police + 1]) %>%    # 0=not involved; 1=involved
    mutate(race = ifelse(race == "Not Availabletive American/Not Availabletive Alaskan",
                           "NA", as.character(race)))    # This one is too long for x-axis labels

gun_deaths_modified %>%
    group_by(police_lab, race) %>%
    summarize(race_total = n()) %>%
    # Still grouped by police
    mutate(race_percent = race_total / sum(race_total) * 100) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = race, y = race_percent, fill = police_lab)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Race percentage in police involved/not involved groups") +
    # Tilt xtick labels to avoid overlap
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'police_lab' (override with `.groups` argument)

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/police%20vs%20race-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# This is the first idea that comes off the top of my head
# Stratifying the "age" column may give bar plots, should also be good
gun_deaths_modified %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = race, y = num_age, fill = police_lab)) +
    geom_boxplot(position = "dodge") +
    labs(title = "Age in police involved/not involved, per race")
```

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/all%20three%20factors-1.png)<!-- -->

Think about performing stats such as a t.test to see if differences you
are plotting are statistically significant

``` r
t.test(gun_deaths_modified$num_age ~ gun_deaths_modified$police)
```

    ## 
    ##  Welch Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  gun_deaths_modified$num_age by gun_deaths_modified$police
    ## t = 22.449, df = 1491.8, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  7.224642 8.608106
    ## sample estimates:
    ## mean in group 0 mean in group 1 
    ##        43.96773        36.05136

Above is the t-test telling whether there is a significant difference
between the average age of the group “police involved” and “police not
involved”.

The conclusion is *significant* (p\<0.05).

``` r
count_by_police_and_race = gun_deaths_modified %>%
    group_by(police_lab, race) %>%
    count() %>%
    # Now convert "race" to columns, i.e., make the table wider, using `spread()`
    spread(race, n)   # tibble format actually lost after calling `spread`. This is strange since `spread` is a tidyr func
kable(count_by_police_and_race, format = "markdown")
```

| police\_lab  | Asian/Pacific Islander | Black | Hispanic |  NA | White |
| :----------- | ---------------------: | ----: | -------: | --: | ----: |
| involved     |                     30 |   356 |      282 |  25 |   709 |
| not involved |                   1296 | 22937 |     8739 | 891 | 65515 |

``` r
chisq.test(as.matrix(count_by_police_and_race[-1]))    # remove the "row name" column
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's Chi-squared test
    ## 
    ## data:  as.matrix(count_by_police_and_race[-1])
    ## X-squared = 270.02, df = 4, p-value < 2.2e-16

Above Chi-square test inquires whether the number of gun deaths in
different racial groups is independent of police involvement.

I just left one R coding block blank here. Similar to the previous
t-test, we are able to perform t-test in groups of different police
involvement of various races.

Finally, all together now:

Add the p-value of the t-test directly on the graph.

``` r
gun_deaths_num_age %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(police), y = num_age)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("not involved", "involved"), breaks = c(0, 1)) +
    labs(title = "Age in police involved/not involved groups") +
    stat_compare_means(method = "t.test")
```
