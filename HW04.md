Exploring Gun Deaths in America
================
Ricardo Muñiz Trejo

## Objectives

  - To explore gun death data curated by FiveThirtyEight [original data
    available here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) by
      - Month
      - Intent
      - Age and sex
      - Education
      - Season
      - Intent by race
      - Police-relatedness

## Read in the data

The gun\_deaths.csv is provided in the repository.

``` r
library(tidyverse)    # load tidyverse packages, including ggplot2
library(knitr)
library(ggsignif) #This package adds significance bars to plots, useful for the last exercise
theme_set(theme_bw())

# read in the data
guns <-read.csv("gun_deaths.csv")

str(guns)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    100798 obs. of  10 variables:
    ##  $ year     : int  2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 2012 ...
    ##  $ month    : int  1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 ...
    ##  $ intent   : chr  "Suicide" "Suicide" "Suicide" "Suicide" ...
    ##  $ police   : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
    ##  $ sex      : chr  "M" "F" "M" "M" ...
    ##  $ age      : chr  "34" "21" "60" "64" ...
    ##  $ race     : chr  "Asian/Pacific Islander" "White" "White" "White" ...
    ##  $ hispanic : int  100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 998 ...
    ##  $ place    : chr  "Home" "Street" "Other specified" "Home" ...
    ##  $ education: chr  "BA+" "Some college" "BA+" "BA+" ...

## Generating a data frame that summarizes the number of gun deaths per month and printing using `kable()`.

Knitr is part of the knitr package. Allows you to change column names
and add captions and make pretty tables in your knitted document. Hint:
set the argument format = “markdown”

| Month | Deaths per month |
| :---- | ---------------: |
| Jan   |             8273 |
| Feb   |             7093 |
| Mar   |             8289 |
| Apr   |             8455 |
| May   |             8669 |
| Jun   |             8677 |
| Jul   |             8989 |
| Aug   |             8783 |
| Sep   |             8508 |
| Oct   |             8406 |
| Nov   |             8243 |
| Dec   |             8413 |

### Generating a bar chart with human-readable labels on the x-axis. That is, each month should be labeled “Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar” (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

## Generating a bar chart that identifies the number of gun deaths associated with each type of intent cause of death. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest values.

| Intent        | No. of deaths |
| :------------ | ------------: |
| Suicide       |         63175 |
| Homicide      |         35176 |
| Accidental    |          1639 |
| Undetermined  |           807 |
| Not Available |             1 |

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/intent-1.png)<!-- -->

## Generating a boxplot visualizing the age of gun death victims, by sex. Print the average age of female gun death victims.

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/age_&_sex-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## [1] "The average age of female gun death victims was 44 years"

## How many white males with at least a high school education were killed by guns in 2012?

    ## [1] "18452 white males with at least high school education were killed by guns in 2012"

## Which season of the year has the most gun deaths?

Assume that:

  - Winter = January-March
  - Spring = April-June
  - Summer = July-September
  - Fall = October-December

<!-- end list -->

    ## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `season`.

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## [1] "The season with most gun deaths was Summer with 26280 deaths in total from 2012-2014"

# These are more open ended questions from here on out, you could look at making multiple summaries or types of plots.

### Are whites who are killed by guns more likely to die because of suicide or homicide? How does this compare to blacks and hispanics?

**Answer** Looking at the gross numbers, some general trends start to
arise. It is clear by the data that white people gun deaths are more
related to suicide than homicide. On the other hand, black people gun
deaths are the opposite, with more deaths related to homicide than
suicide. Meanwhile, hispanic population seems about the same in
proportion.

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/race-1.png)<!-- -->

**Answer (continuation)** When analyzing percentages per race, it is
worth noting that the percentage of black people killed by homicide is
around the same as white people that committed suicide (85%). This means
that white people is as likely to die from suicide than black people is
to die from homicide. For the hispanic population, the likeliness of
dying because of homicide is 20% lower than black people, but it remains
as the most likely cause of gun death.

(hint maybe looking at percentages would be good)

| Race     | Intent   | Total deaths | Percentage per race |
| :------- | :------- | -----------: | ------------------: |
| Black    | Homicide |        19510 |               85.41 |
| Black    | Suicide  |         3332 |               14.59 |
| Hispanic | Homicide |         5634 |               63.99 |
| Hispanic | Suicide  |         3171 |               36.01 |
| White    | Homicide |         9147 |               14.18 |
| White    | Suicide  |        55372 |               85.82 |

### Are police-involved gun deaths significantly different from other gun deaths? Assess the relationship between police involvement and age, police involvement and race, and the intersection of all three variables.

| Police involvement | Race | Number of deaths |
| :----------------- | :--- | ---------------: |
| Not involved       | AP   |              529 |
| Involved           | AP   |               30 |
| Not involved       | BL   |            19153 |
| Involved           | BL   |              356 |
| Not involved       | His  |             5351 |
| Involved           | His  |              282 |
| Not involved       | NNA  |              301 |
| Involved           | NNA  |               25 |
| Not involved       | WH   |             8431 |
| Involved           | WH   |              709 |

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/police-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

| Police involvement | Total gun deaths | Percentage (%) | Average deaths among all races |
| :----------------- | ---------------: | -------------: | -----------------------------: |
| Not involved       |            33765 |             96 |                         6753.0 |
| Involved           |             1402 |              4 |                          280.4 |

**Answer** As seen before, suicide represents an important portion of
the database and can bias the analysis of police involvement, so the
data was filtered to only include homicide.

About police involvement and race, it seems that police officers are
involved in only 4% of homicides in the United States (see table). When
evaluated by race, involvement is generally low too. If we consider the
average deaths among all races, black and white populations are the most
affected by police involvement, while hispanic population are right on
the average value (see table).

Think about performing stats such as a t.test to see if differences you
are plotting are statistically significant

``` r
#It's been a while since I had my statistics course, so if this analysis is wrong in any way, feel free to explain to me how to correct it. 


#Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check for normality in the data
ks.test(dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Not involved"],
       dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Involved"])
```

    ## Warning in ks.test(dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Not involved"],
    ## dp_age$age[dp_age$police == : p-value will be approximate in the presence of
    ## ties

    ## 
    ##  Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

    ## D = 0.15022, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: two-sided

``` r
#Fligner-Killeen test to check for heteroscedasticity

       dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Involved"]))
```

    ## Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = 2.3927, df = 1, p-value = 0.1219

``` r
#Mann-Whitman-Wilcoxon test to compare non-normal samples
wilcox.test(dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Not involved"],
                       dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Involved"])
```

    ## 
    ##  Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Not involved"] and dp_age$age[dp_age$police == "Involved"]
    ## W = 19254537, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

| Police involvement | Median victim’s age | Youngest victim |
| :----------------- | ------------------: | --------------: |
| Not involved       |                  29 |               0 |
| Involved           |                  34 |              12 |

**Answer** The distribution of victim’s age is not exactly normal (see
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results, p \< 0.001), but the data has
homoscedasticity (see the Fligner-Killen test, p \> 0.05), therefore,
the Mann-Whitman-Wilcoxon test is a better option to assess statistical
differences between samples than the t-test. According to the analysis,
the victims’ age is statistically higher when police is involved. Check
the table for the median values. It is also noticeable than police
officers didn’t shoot anyone younger than 12.

``` r
#Wilcoxon test for every race, age and police involvement.
wilcox.test(deaths_police$age[deaths_police$police == "Not involved" & deaths_police$race == "AP"],
       deaths_police$age[deaths_police$police == "Involved" & deaths_police$race == "AP"])
```

Finally, all together now:

![](HW04_files/figure-gfm/police_3-1.png)<!-- -->

**Answer** According to our analysis, there is no significant
correlation of the age victims and police involvement in Asian/Pacific
islander (AP), White (WH), and…uh…I guess native American/Alaskan?
(NNA)\* populations. In contrast, Black and Hispanic people is
statistically older when police is involved in their cause of death.

\* The original tag was “Not *Availabletive* American/Alaskan”…but I
image that was a typo or something.
